  <p> Hey! I'm 17 and I'm thinking of maybe Majoring in Phisilogy or somthing in writing. I live in San Antonio Texas! I love reading, writing, music, videogames, and working out. I'm mostly taking this course becuase I don't no much about web and code and I love learning. Also I have been a Member of the Church for all my life. </p>
